# OE-Changed-Files-List
This is a Progress OpenEdge program that will create a list of files that have been changed since a specified date. The program has the following fields:

Directory: The directory to search.

Modified Since: The starting date. Files modified on or after this date will be listed in the output.

Scan Subdirectories: If this box is checked, the program will go though any subdirectories in the search directory and look for changed files in those too.


When you click the OK button, the directories will be searched and the output will be exported to the "changedfileslist.txt" file. This file is plain text and can be opened with Notepad or any other text editor. The output will list the path of each modified file along with the date and time of last modification.

Click the Cancel button to exit the program.
